## THE IE EXPERIENCE INSTRUCTIONS *   

Welcome to the IE Experience where you will lead the life of an IE student for a day.

At all moments throughout the game your progress in will be tracked through three variables: knowledge, health and will to live.

Once you start the game you will be able to navigate the IE University map and access a series of rooms with their respective qualities. In some rooms you will be able to complete challenges or puzzles to gain points. You will have the option to pick up objects to add to your inventory or perform actions like “drinking coffee” that will also add points and that will be room specific.

Your goal in the game is to increase all of your status bars to 100. Once this condition is met you will have won the game.
